**Description**
  
Project 14 is where we piece together our project as a full stack application. We connect our front end React project with our back end Express application. We are now making calls to the API we have created and storing data into the WTWR Mongo Database.

**Technologies and  techniques**  
  
The additional technologies and techniques used are React Hooks and Routes, Contexts to allow us to store information about the current user. Logic for signing up and signing in/out. Authorization using tokens to ensure certain parts of the application are protected and only accessible by an authorized user.
