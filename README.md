**Description**
  
Project 11 includes additional functionality where a user can create a new clothing item and specify the weather it is best suited for. A user may also delete an item. 

**Technologies and  techniques**  
  
The additional technologies and techniques used are Routes and Links for navigation. We are also using a mock DB so we are now making API calls to add and remove clothing items.
